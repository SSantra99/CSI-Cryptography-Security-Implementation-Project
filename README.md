# CSI-Cryptography-Security-Implementation-Project
This contains implementations of some cryptographic ciphers together with some solutions of given assignment in our class. The '.c'- files, .py - files and '.pdf' files have been uploaded here. When there is an use of 'gmp'- file in the code, I have used ' -lgmp ' to compile the code.
I have taken help from Ankan and Ashim for solving some assignment-questions. For programming assignments, I have used open source chatgpt, google and the book "Introduction To Algorithms"( by CLRS, third edition).
